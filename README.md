# Python Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to extract meaningful insights from a dataset. The project involves data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and statistical analysis to uncover key trends and patterns. The goal is to provide actionable information that can support data-driven decision-making.

## Data

The project utilizes a dataset related to customer and sales data. The dataset contains information about customer details and the products they bought.

## Methods

The following methods were used in this EDA project:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
* **Data Transformation:** Feature engineering, data type conversions, and scaling.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Statistical summaries, distributions, and relationships between variables.
* **Data Visualization:** Creating charts and graphs to visualize patterns and trends.

## Libraries Used

* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
* **Matplotlib:** For creating basic visualizations.
* **Seaborn:** For creating advanced and informative statistical graphics.

## Key Findings

Married women aged 26–35 years from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, primarily working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors, are more likely to purchase products from the Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories.

### Recommendations

- **Target married women aged 26–35** through personalized Diwali campaigns across major states like **Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka**.
- **Focus marketing efforts on professionals in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors**, as they form a large customer base.
- Promote products in high-performing categories like **Food, Clothing, and Electronics** through festive offers and bundles.
- Launch **regional digital ad campaigns** in Central, Southern, and Western zones to enhance customer engagement.
- Provide **bundle discounts or loyalty programs** for repeat buyers to increase average order value and retention.
